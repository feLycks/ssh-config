How to Connect your github repository using SSH Key

STEP #1 -->
First you have to create new ssh Key with the following command : On your terminal run 
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Add your github email address on the above command
This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.


STEP #2 -- > 
Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter] 

By default use the provided path and press Enter

STEP #3 -->
Enter a password when prompted. This password will be required for authenticating once you logged in.
Now your ssh key will get generated. You have to add the public key to your github account.
Copy the public key to clipboard. You can try any of the following methods

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

STEP #4 --> 
Login to your github account, got to settings page

In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.


In the “Title” field, add a descriptive label for the new key. 
For example, if you’re doing a personal project, you might call this key “Project-One”.

STEP #5  
Paste your key into the “Key” field.
Click Add SSH key.
If prompted, confirm your GitHub password.
After you’ve set up your SSH key and added it to your GitHub account, you can test your connection with the following command : 

$ ssh -T git@github.com


Type yes when prompted for ‘continue connection’
Now you may see the message like this -- > Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.



NOTE: 
If you are accessing your repositories over the SSH protocol, you will receive a warning message each time you connect to a new IP address for github.com. As long as the IP address from the warning is in the range of IP addresses , you shouldn't be concerned. !!


CONGRATULATIONS, now connect to your github account using the ssh key !!!
